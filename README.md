# Customer-Life-Time-Value-Analysis-using-pandas.
The project includes CLV analysis for the businesses. The data set used is of Europe region, from Dec 2010 to Dec 2011.


# 🧮 Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction

### 📍 Project Status: Phase 1 Completed ✅ on 8/11/2025
- **Completed Tasks:**
  - Data cleaning (`dropna`, handling nulls, etc.)
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature Engineering
  - Model Training:
    - Linear Regression
    - Random Forest Regressor
  - Model Evaluation:
    - Linear Regression RMSE: **969.85**
    - Random Forest RMSE: **1121.98**

✅ CLV Analysis Completed Successfully!

---

### ⏸️ Next Steps (Upcoming Phase)
- Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis / KMeans)
- Dashboard Creation using **Power BI**
- Integration of results with visualization tools

---

### 🧠 Insights:
- Both models were tested to predict future monetary value.
- Linear Regression performed slightly better based on RMSE.
- Future scope includes better feature engineering and visual analytics.
